# Enforcement System

## Point System

At NetherGames, our enforcement system is points-based. Once you reach a certain amount of points, you will be banned or muted for a set amount of time as follows:

* 2 points = 1 day
* 4 points = 1 week
* 6 points = 2 weeks
* 8 points = 1 month
* 10 points = 2 months
* 12 points = 4 months
* 14 points = 8 months
* 16 points = Indefinite

These thresholds are per-category, meaning if you have one punishment for using cheats and one for teaming in solo mode, you will not be issued a two-week ban, only two separate one-week and one-day bans.

## Punishments for offences

## Point Reduction

The amount of points you receive is temporary. You can return your account to good standing by not receiving any punishment for one month, reducing your account’s points by one.

Note that while you can reduce the number of points issued to your account, every punishment given will be permanently added to your account’s record and cannot be removed. However, your record will not affect the punishments given—only the amount of points is used to determine the type and duration of punishments. Your history will only be used for administrative purposes—for example, while applying for a staff position.

## Punishments

All punishments issued to an account apply to it and any other associated accounts. For instance, if you have siblings and they also play NetherGames with you, if you are banned or muted, they will also be banned or muted too. Another example is an instance of account sharing. Suppose you previously gave your login details to another player, and they have used your account to join NetherGames. If they are banned or muted, that punishment will apply retrospectively to your account even though you did not commit the offence.

## Evidence

Punishments issued by staff members are supported by evidence collected at the time of the offence being committed. The evidence submitted by staff members is reviewed during the appeals & disputes process by a member of the Appeals & Disputes Division (different from the volunteer who issued the punishment).

Evidence for offences is for internal use only and will not be shared with players or third parties. You will not be able to review the evidence submitted against you.
