# Partner Program

The Partner Program is a select-entry partnership for popular content creators and teams. Partnership offers by the network are made on a case-by-case basis.

All partners must actively post Minecraft-focused content. There are no concrete requirements for followers/subscribers/views to be eligible to apply.

We will consider content creators and teams from all platformsâ€”the partner program is more comprehensive than YouTube channels.

Your account must also follow the Terms of Service for the platform. For instance, you must be at least 13 years old to create a YouTube account.

The perks offered to partners include:
* Ability to set a custom nickname in-game (as opposed to selecting a randomly generated one)
* Access to [Titan rank perks](https://store.nethergames.org) (public parties, private games, 40-player party limit, replays, exclusive guild tag, and more)
* An exclusive Partner rank both on Discord and in-game
* Permission to run official NetherGames giveaways through your channel at no cost to you (we will run giveaways at our request and discretion)

## Partner guidelines

Partners are not exempt from network regulations and are expected to uphold higher standards as role models for the community. We encourage partners to familiarise themselves with network regulations [here](https://ngmc.co/tac) and Discord server regulations [here](https://support.nethergames.org/discord-server-regulations.html).

In addition, we will not consider applications from users who have excessive warnings under their account or who have been previously banned/muted for severe offences.
