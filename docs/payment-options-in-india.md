# Payment Options in India

There are currently limited payment options for players in India due to restrictions on cards making international transactions.

When making a payment on our website, you may receive an error message such as "Card not supported" or "Transaction not allowed". This is likely because your bank has international transactions disabled. You will need to contact your bank and request to enable international transactions and try again.

If contacting your bank does not work, at this stage, there is no other alternative to buy items on our store at this stage.

Note that NetherGames does not support UPI at this stage but we have plans to support it early 2026.
