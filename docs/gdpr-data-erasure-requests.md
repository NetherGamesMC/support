# GDPR Data Erasure Requests

Users from the EU have a right to erase their data per the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).

## Submitting Erasure Requests

You can send a data erasure request by choosing "Account Deletion" at https://ngmc.co/request. You will be required to sign-in with your Xbox account.

In addition, per EU regulation, you can request a full copy of the erased data in either a JSON or CSV format. We reserve the right to delete internal company data from those data batches not directly linked to your account. You can request this via our ModMail services within our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/UFQfD6ThVF).

## Data Erasure Scope

Erasing your data will delete the following data points:

* **Player profile:** Ranks and perks, purchases, XP, level, tier, achievements
* **Social profile:** Guild membership, friend list, party status
* **Statistics profile:** Statistics for all games
* **Record profile:** Chat logs, match replay participation

::: warning PLEASE NOTE
Punishments result from a breach of our Terms of Service. This data is required to maintain community safety. The GDPR has exclusions for "operational data," which is data that we have a legitimate, reasonable interest in keeping even throughout a data deletion request. Punishments are the only data point that falls under this category, and we reserve the right to keep punishment data even after a GDPR request for up to 12 months or until the punishment expires.
