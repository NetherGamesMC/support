# Guilds System

The guilds system at NetherGames helps to promote teamwork and increase competition between others.

## Creating a guild

::: warning PLEASE NOTE
You must have Legend rank or higher to create a guild.
:::

To create a guild, use the Social Menu item in your hotbar when you're in a lobby (2nd last slot) and click 'Guilds'. A create guild option will come up if you're not in a guild.

Please note that your guild name cannot be longer than 20 characters. Inappropriate language in guild names is not permitted.

## Inviting other players

If you're the guild leader or an officer, you can invite other players to your guild. Use the Social Menu and click the 'Invite players' button, then select an online player from the dropdown.

You can also hit other players with the Social Menu item. A button to invite the player to your guild will show up.

## Promoting & demoting guild members/officers and kicking players

To promote guild members, demote guild officers or transfer leadership, use the Social Menu and click the 'Guild Members' button inside the Guilds menu. A list showing everyone in the guild will pop up. To manage their role or kick them out of the guild, click on their name, and applicable options will appear.

You can only transfer leadership to someone who has a Legend rank. As the guild leader, you can use the [online portal](https://portal.nethergames.org) to manage members and transfer leadership.

## Earning guild experience

Every time you win a game in (Bedwars, Conquests, SkyWars, Survival Games, The Bridge), you earn 10 guild XP for that win. Every time you win a game in Bedwars Duels and Duels(1v1), you earn 3 guild XP for that win. You do not earn any guild XP if you do not win the match.

::: warning PLEASE NOTE
The gamemodes which are not mentioned above do not give any guild XP.

## Setting a guild MOTD

::: warning PLEASE NOTE
Your guild must be at least level 100 to use this feature.
:::

A guild MOTD is a message to all guild members whenever they join the server. This can help send announcements or encourage your guild members before they play matches.

To set a guild MOTD, use the Social Menu, and within the Guilds Menu, select the 'Edit MOTD' button. There will be an input box for you to type in your message.

## Setting a guild tag

::: warning PLEASE NOTE
Your guild must be at least level 25 to use this feature.
:::

A guild tag is a small text displayed at the end of each guild member's name tag while in the lobby. It is a purely cosmetic feature.

To set a guild tag, use the Social Menu, and within the Guilds Menu, select the 'Change guild tag' button. There will be an input box for you to type in a tag. 

Your guild tag cannot be more than 8 characters long.

In addition to the text itself, you can also select a colour for that tag. There are a couple of colour options, and you will be able to select more colours as your guild levels up.
* **Level 25-49:** Gray
* **Level 50-149:** Gray & Dark Aqua
* **Level 150-299:** Gray, Dark Aqua & Yellow
* **Level 300-499:** Gray, Dark Aqua, Yellow & Dark Green
