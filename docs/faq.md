**Q: My account was banned for "Chargeback." What should I do?**
A: You or your guardian claimed to your bank that NetherGames charged you without your consent. If you did not receive the service, you should open a Billing Issue at https://ngmc.co/request. Read more at https://ngmc.co/refund.

**Q: What payment methods do you support in the store?**
A: We only support purchasing using major debit/credit card brands (worldwide, with banks that support international purchases, not very common in, e.g., India, but we are working on integrating with Paytm), Paysafecard, and PayPal. Google Pay, Apple Pay, and PayPal require a valid debit/credit card issued in a supported country.

**Q: My card is being declined. What should I do?**
A: This is an issue with your bank. Please make sure to enable international payments with your bank. If the issue remains, contact them for help, specifying the timestamps you attempted to link your card. NetherGames is unable to help you in this case.

**Q: I was charged too much for a payment. Can I get a refund?**
A: Yes! Please submit a Billing Issue at https://ngmc.co/request and be sure to select the affected payment.

**Q: Why can't I create new subscriptions using PayPal in the store?**
A: Due to low demand and high maintenance costs, we decided to temporarily sunset PayPal subscriptions. You can still buy gift codes using PayPal and use them just like you would use a subscription. Redeeming a Titan gift code while having an active subscription will automatically extend your Titan end date.

**Q: Do you offer sales in the store?**
A: Yes, we occasionally offer seasonal sales. However, we do not announce these in advance. Join our Discord server and stay tuned for updates!

**Q: Why is my price not discounted when purchasing a gift?**
A: Gift codes are exempted from localized pricing (https://ngmc.co/localizedpricing) to prevent abuse.

**Q: My PayPal payments are stuck in a "Pending" state. What should I do?**
A: Due to technical constraints, you must authorize each new PayPal payment. This will open up a popup window with which your browser may have problems. Be sure that you are not running aggressive popup-blocking extensions. Press the "Reopen Authorization Window" button in the bottom-left if no window appears. If you keep having issues, try purchasing using a card or create a Billing Issue at https://ngmc.co/request.
