# Buying a Premium Rank

To buy a rank, open the NetherGames Store.

Please choose one of the ranks above to view its price, perks, and eligibility.

::: info PLEASE NOTE
If you already own Ultra or Emerald, upgrading your rank to a higher one is discounted so that you would pay the same price you would've if you bought that higher rank orginally.
:::

You can either buy the rank for yourself or create a gift code to be used by other players.

## Buying for yourself

In the review modal, choose your desired payment method and apply a coupon code optionally.
Currently, we support card payments from major brands such as Mastercard, Visa, American Express, and PayPal.
You can also autocomplete your card information for future purchases using Google Pay or Apple Pay if supported on your device.
When using PayPal, remember to complete the mandatory authorization for every purchase. To avoid this, add a card instead.
