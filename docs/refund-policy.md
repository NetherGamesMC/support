# Refund Policy

The NETHERGAMES NETWORK ("NetherGames," "we," "us," "our") provides an online store website—store.nethergames.org ("Store")—for its users to purchase products and its associated advantages to using. By using the Store, you agree to this Policy. We have developed this Policy to outline the terms and conditions regarding these products and our Policy on refunds.

By purchasing ranks from us through the Store, you are purchasing access to use virtual items and certain features/privileges on our Minecraft servers. The virtual items are not supplied by us but by Mojang AB ("Mojang"), the Minecraft Bedrock Edition game developer. When you purchase a rank and its associated perks, you pay the NetherGames Network, not Mojang. Furthermore, we are not affiliated with Mojang or its owning company Microsoft Corporation.

Privileges & features associated with a rank are subject to change for players who currently hold it without prior notice. Players with a rank are given access to virtual items and cosmetic features on our servers, and purchasing a rank does not necessarily guarantee a win in every game. The outcome of games is based on your skill, not your rank and perks.

Purchased ranks are to be used on one account only. You may not buy one rank and use it across multiple accounts. If you attempt to 'scam' ranks, you will be permanently banned from our services, and we will remove your rank. We have the right to terminate purchased ranks from our Store if the game or privileges we provide no longer exist, but we will stop selling them before it is phased out. We offer no guarantees to the existence of your purchases, but we do our best to keep the privileges available.

If your rank has been removed from your account without reason, you may contact our support team, providing proof of purchase. If you do not provide any evidence of purchase, your rank will not be re-added, regardless if we, without reason, removed it from your account.

If a rank or stats transfer token has been purchased, there must be sufficient evidence linking your new and old accounts for your account data transfer. Due to privacy & security reasons, we cannot transfer account data between usernames if we cannot establish a link between both accounts in our system. In this case, you may be offered the opportunity to prove your account ownership.

We provide access to playing on all our Minecraft servers free of charge. We may limit the number of privileges regular players have and grant extra benefits to players who purchase a rank. Once you have purchased a rank, you have the opportunity to ask for a refund or change the account it is under within the first 5 days, after the first 5 days NetherGames is not obligated to provide any refund or transfer to a different account due to an accidental or change of mind purchase. To request a refund or transfer to a different username within the first 5 days, open a "Billing Issue" ticket at [ngmc.co/request](https://ngmc.co/request). If you have violated our rules, terms & conditions, or policies your account may be banned which does not entitle you to a refund, as you agree to this statement and our outlined rules & policies when you use our services.

Gifts that have already been claimed are not eligible for a refund even if it is within 5 days of the purchase, this is to prevent gift scamming.

Players who have purchased a Titan subscription do have the opportunity to transfer the remainder of their subscription to another player if they wish to do so, provided the player with the Titan subscription is not currently banned. This can be done by opening a "Billing Issue" ticket at [ngmc.co/request](https://ngmc.co/request).

If you become falsely banned and have a successful appeal whilst holding a Titan subscription, you may contact our support to recieve an extention of your subscription for the time that you were banned. 

Ranks are not pay-to-win on our servers, nor do they exempt you from any warning or punishment issued by our staff members. We would offer a refund if a purchase were unauthorized or made by error. Filing a chargeback/dispute request with your credit/debit card provider or PayPal will permanently ban you from all our services and your rank removed. Profits from ranks are used to support service maintenance costs, and we hope that by giving privileges to ranks, you will buy them and help us maintain our services. We try to explain how the rank will benefit you, but these can change anytime because we redevelop old games and develop new features/games.
