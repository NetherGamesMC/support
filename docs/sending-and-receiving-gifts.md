# Sending & Receiving Gifts

With the NetherGames store, you can purchase gifts to send to other players as well as open gifts given to you by other players. In this article, you can learn how to purchase a gift, redeem a gift, and the rules regarding sending gifts to other players.

## Rules regarding gifts
Gifts come in two forms, USD gifts & geo-locked gifts. We have heavily reduced the prices of items for players in certain countries in order to make these items more affordable. As a result, if you choose to purchase a geo-locked gift in the reduced price, you can only send the gift to select countries. These are as follows:

* Gifts bought priced in currencies **USD, AUD, CAD, EUR & GBP** can be opened by players in any country.
* Gifts bought priced in currencies **PLN, BRL & MXN** can only be opened by players in Poland, Brazil, Mexico, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Pakistan & Turkey.
* Gifts bought priced in currencies **INR, BDT, IDR, LKR & MYR** can only be opened by players in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Pakistan & Turkey.
* Gifts bought in currencies **PKR & TRY** can only be opened by players in Pakistan & Turkey.

If you contact us wishing to unlock a gift that goes against these rules, we will not be able to help you and if the purchase has passed the change-of-mind refund period you will not be able to get a refund.

As per our [Refund Policy](https://support.nethergames.org/localised-pricing), once a gift has been redeemed by another player, it is no longer eligible for a refund within the change-of-mind refund period. This rule is in order to prevent gift scamming.

::: warning BEWARE
Our system can easily detect if you or the recipient of the gift tries to use a VPN to falsify your actual location. This will not work and you will not qualify for a refund if you attempt to do this.
