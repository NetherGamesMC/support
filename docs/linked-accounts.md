# What are Linked Accounts?
A linked account is when your account is 'linked' to another player or device. Both accounts attached to that device end up being punished if found guilty of violating the [NetherGames Guidelines](https://support.nethergames.org/enforcement-system).

::: info PLEASE NOTE
Sharing your account is **NOT** recommended, and will lead to both users being restricted from accessing our network if a punishment is issued. NetherGames is not responsible for who you give your account access to and is therefore not required to unlink your account.

## How can I unlink my account?
It is currently not possible to unlink your account from someone else. This page will be updated as soon as unlinking becomes available. There is currently no ETA on when this might be. When unlinking 'might' become available, there is no guarantee that your unlink request will be accepted.

One example would be sharing your account with a family member who lives at the same location, and shares the same device.

## What if I need to have my account linked?
If you need to share your device or account with someone, make sure you 100% trust them before you do so, and that they will not try and break the NetherGames Guidelines. Remember! Your account is at stake to whoever you link up with.


::: PLEASE NOTE
Please refrain from contacting ModMail about unlink requests, or asking when the unlinking department will return as you will receive the same information provided on this article.
