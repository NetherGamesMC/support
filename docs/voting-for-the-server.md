## Monthly Top Voter Competition

The top voter competition is a monthly contest we run for voters which award the winner a paid rank.

### How it works

To qualify for the prize, you must be one of the "top voters" with the most votes at the month's end, which means that you will need to vote every day to be eligible.

At the end of the month, all top voters will go into the draw for a free rank upgrade. One random top voter will receieve a free rank upgrade.

A free rank upgrade could be from non-ranked to Ultra, Ultra to Emerald, Emerald to Legend, or Legend to +1-month Titan.

### Conditions

* You cannot win consecutive contests
* Legend players will be given a 1-month Titan rank, Legend rank will remain after a 1-month Titan expires.
