## How the appeals system works
#love
Our appeals system involves an impartial staff member (seperate from the staff member who issued the punishment) verifying the evidence attached and making a decision on whether the punishment is justified. Unfortunately, due to privacy reasons, we cannot share the evidence attached to punishments as this can invade the privacy of the player or staff member who captured the evidence. We understand that this makes it hard to appeal a punishment without fully knowing the specific incident that resulted in the punishment, but understand that when submitting an appeal the evidence will be fairly reviewed again by us.

You may received a punishment because an account linked to you has been punished. Only the account which was directly punished can appeal the punishment by logging onto the portal - we are unable to accept appeals from linked accounts. You can learn more about how the linked accounts system works [here](https://support.nethergames.org/linked-accounts).

## Frequently asked questions

**Q: I can't access the linked account which received the punishment, what can I do?** A: Unfortunately there is nothing we can do to help you. Only the account who directly received the punishment is able to appeal under our current system. Staff will not be able to help you appeal the punishment. 

**Q: I am punished because of a linked account but I don't own the other account** A: Our linked accounts system detects when devices or accounts are shared and pairs players together to prevent punishment evasion. We have no way to remove linked accounts, and thus we recommend to not share your account with other players. 

**Q: My appeal was denied, what can I do?** A: If your appeal was denied, the decision is final. Staff will not be able to discuss the punishment with you as the appeal system is the final opportunity for a punishment to be reviewed.
