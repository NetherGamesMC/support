# Applying for a YouTube Rank

The YouTube rank grants content creators a special rank with all Legend rank perks, including custom nickname permissions. The YouTube rank also grants the permission to post NetherGames-related videos in the #media channel on our Discord server. We will review your content when applying to ensure your channel meets the requirements.
