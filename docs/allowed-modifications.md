# Allowed Modifications

We understand that players, in particular people who use PC devices to play on NetherGames, use a range of modifications to improve their gameplay experience. However, some modifications developed by third parties can be used to provide an unfair advantage over other players, ruining the concept of fair play.

::: PLEASE NOTE
Not all modifications are allowed to be used on NetherGames. The general rule is that any modifications used while playing on the network should not provide a significant advantage over other users playing the same game. If your modification/addon is not listed below, consider it used at your own risk! Please feel free to ask through our ModMail via Discord if you need clarification on a modification.
:::

Unfair advantages include, but are not limited to:
Displaying information relating to the game that is not generally available to players (i.e., distance to other players, player tracers)
Automating gameplay functions (i.e., key-mapper, aim assisting, auto clickers)

If you notice a player using any modifications not permitted below, please report them through our NetherGames Discord bot or the [NetherGames Portal](https://ngmc.co/request).
