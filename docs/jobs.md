# Jobs

At NetherGames, we pride ourselves on being a community-based Minecraft server. The players should always be at the forefront of what we do and try to achieve.

What differentiates us from other servers is that most of our staff members (owners included) are dedicated volunteers who receive no compensation for their work in the network. What started as a hobby project in January 2016 has become one of the world's largest Minecraft Bedrock server networks. Over 3.9 million players have logged on since late 2017 (when we enforced Xbox Live authentication) to play over 14 game types. It continues to be a rewarding side project for us today—one that does not exist to make a profit but rather to serve the community.

Our 60+ staff members come from around the globe—we all share a passion for the server and aim to ensure each player enjoys playing on NetherGames.

There are several qualities and personality traits that we look for in applicants:
* Committed to helping the network and other players
* Friendly, fun, and professional attitude
* Active and willing to learn

When you work at NetherGames, you get to work with a highly motivated and friendly staff team. Some of the friends you make and the relationships you establish while working on our team extend far beyond your time here. It is also an excellent opportunity to step outside your comfort zone to further yourself. You will learn how to work with others in a team effectively and handle certain situations while keeping cool, among many other things.

::: info PLEASE NOTE
All staff positions here require applicants to be 13 years or older and registered on our Discord server (except for Trainee, which requires 14+).

## Application Process

Registering your interest in a staff position by applying to us is the first step. You will always receive a response from us about your application, regardless of whether it is accepted or denied.

After you submit your application:

1. Our Applications Department staff members will review your application within one week, reading your responses to the questions. If your application needs more detail (i.e., vague answers) or meets the requirements, your application will be allowed at this stage.
2. If your application looks good, it will be shortlisted for review by People & Culture Department team members. We will perform background checks on you and cross-check any references you provide. We may also check your application for plagiarism.
3. If you pass the 2nd review stage, you will be invited to partake in a text or voice interview on our Discord server, where we can get to know you better. You will be asked various questions, from personal life to your experience with Minecraft and anywhere in between.
4. You may be asked to partake in additional skills tests depending on the position you applied for (e.g., a live build test for builders)
5. Your responses in the interview and results of your skills test (if applicable) will be reviewed by the Executive Team. Suppose you are a suitable fit for the NetherGames staff team. In that case, you will be accepted and asked to sign an agreement form (which varies from position to position).

## Tips

Before you apply, we've had thousands of applications over the past few years, so we know what makes a great application. Here are some tips from us:

* Select a staff position for which you are a good fit. Applying for several jobs simply for a better chance of becoming a staff member does not work. You may be blocked if you do this.
* Avoid directly asking to be accepted in your application. Begging does not convince us that you will be a suitable applicant. Instead, it tells us that you are more likely interested in an excellent-looking rank. Show us why you are the ideal candidate instead.
* When answering a long-answer question, elaborate, give more detail than minimally required, and be concise. We want to know more about you and what you can do, but we also prefer to spend less than 2 hours reading your application.
* Use proper grammar and punctuation in your answers. Being professional suggests that you may be able to uphold our expectations of our staff members.
* Proofread your application several times after you've answered all the required questions. Applications with many grammatical errors suggest that you rushed them and ignored detail.
* Be truthful in your answers. We want to know who you are, not who someone else is. Suppose you are accepted, and we find out that your application contains false information. In that case, you may be dismissed and blocked from reapplying.
* Write your application instead of copying from others. Plagiarism is prohibited, and we have procedures to detect such conduct. As with false information, you may be dismissed and blocked from applying if caught.
* Avoid asking about the status of your application while it is pending. Our team, at their leisure, will review your application and notify you when the status has been updated. We may even deny your application if you constantly ask us about the result before it is reviewed.
* If you have previously applied and your application was denied, take note of the tips the Application Reviewer gives you and work on these issues in your next application.
